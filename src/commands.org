While Emacs has many of Kakoune's commands built-in, some commands
still need to be implemented. Such commands are implemented in this
file.

* State Switching Commands

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle kakit/kakit-commands-state-switching.el :mkdirp yes
; -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

(defun kakit-switch-to-normal-mode-local ()
  "Switch to Kakit's Normal state.
Disable any other Kakit minor mode."
  (interactive)
  (kakit--switch-state-local 'normal))

(defun kakit-switch-to-insert-mode-local ()
  "Switch to Kakit's Insert state.
Disable any other Kakit minor mode."
  (interactive)
  (kakit--switch-state-local 'insert))

(provide 'kakit-commands-state-switching)
#+end_src

* Movement Commands

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle kakit/kakit-commands-movement.el :mkdirp yes
;; -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

(defun kakit-forward-word-select ()
  "Move forward one word and select the region traversed."
  (interactive)
  (unless (eobp)
    (unless (use-region-p)
      (push-mark (point) t t))
    (forward-word)))

(defun kakit-backward-word-select ()
  "Move backward one word and select the region traversed."
  (interactive)
  (unless (bobp)
    (unless (use-region-p)
      (push-mark (point) t t))
    (backward-word)))

(defun kakit-word-end-select ()
  "Move point to the end of the word at point and select the region traversed."
  (interactive)
  (kakit-forward-word-select))

(provide 'kakit-commands-movement)
#+end_src
