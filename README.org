* What is Kakit?

Kakit is an Emacs package that brings the powerful and
intuitive modal editing experience of Kakoune directly into
your Emacs environment. If you're a fan of Kakoune's "select
first, then operate" paradigm, Kakit aims to provide a
similar workflow without needing to leave Emacs.  It's
designed to offer a fluid and efficient editing style that
can significantly speed up your text manipulation.

* What is Kakoune?

[[https://kakoune.org/][Kakoune]] is a free, open-source modal code editor that takes
a unique approach to text editing. Unlike traditional
editors where you often specify an action and then a target
(e.g., "delete line"), Kakoune encourages you to *first
select the text you want to operate on*, and then *apply a
command to that selection*. This "selection-first"
philosophy makes for a highly interactive and visual editing
experience. Kakoune is known for its:

- *Modal editing:* It operates in different modes (e.g.,
  normal, insert), where keys have different meanings.
- *Selection-centric design:* Almost every command operates
  on a selection, which is often expanded or manipulated
  before an action is performed.
- *Multiple selections:* You can have multiple independent
  selections, allowing you to perform the same operation on
  several parts of the text simultaneously.
- *Powerful primitives:* Kakoune provides a rich set of
  commands that can be combined in powerful ways to achieve
  complex edits.

* Why Kakit?

Emacs is renowned for its extensibility and its ability to
be molded into virtually any editing environment. Kakit
leverages this power to integrate the best aspects of
Kakoune's modal editing directly into your favorite
editor. This means you can:

- *Enjoy Kakoune's efficiency within Emacs:* Get the "select
  first, then operate" workflow without switching editors.
- *Combine with existing Emacs packages:* Seamlessly
  integrate Kakit with your current Emacs configuration,
  keybindings, and packages.
- *Leverage Emacs's power:* Access Emacs's rich features,
  Lisp extensibility, and extensive ecosystem while
  benefiting from Kakoune-style editing.

* TODO Features [1/2]

Kakit is under active development. Here are some of the key
features it aims to provide:

** DONE Modal editing
** TODO Multiple selections

* Installation

Kakit is not available from any standard Emacs package
repository. Nor can you use a package manager to
automatically install Kakit because it is written in a
literate style, and, AFAIK, there isn't a package manager
that automatically generates source files by tangling.

To install Kakit, first clone the repository, generate the
sources, and then point ~use-package~ to the generated
source files.

#+begin_src sh
$ git clone --branch v1.1.0 --single-branch https://github.com/abhi-kr-2100/Kakit
$ cd Kakit/ && emacs --batch --load build.el
#+end_src

After the source files are generated (around 1 second), add
the following to your ~init.el~:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package kakit
  :load-path "~/path/to/Kakit/src/kakit"
  :ensure nil ; since Kakit is available locally, Emacs
              ; doesn't need ensure it's installed
  
  ; this will enable Kakit mode globally. Remove this line
  ; if you don't want to. You can still manually run
  ; `M-x kakit-normal-mode` to turn on Kakit for only the
  ; current buffer.
  :config (kakit-mode +1))
#+end_src
